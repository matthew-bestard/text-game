# Simple Text-Based Roguelike using Ncurses

This is my Fullstack Academy stackathon project. While Fullstack Academy primarily uses JavaScript as the main programming language, I chose to explore a different programming language for this project: C. I opted for C due to my interest in lower-level programming languages, their ability to manipulate memory directly, and their general efficiency, often referred to as "running closer to the metal."

My goal was to create an ASCII graphics text-based video game that runs in the console and utilizes the ncurses library. I chose this project type for a few reasons:
1. I personally appreciate the aesthetic and functional minimalism of video games from the 70s to the 90s. Games like Rogue, Nethack, Dwarf Fortress, and The Caves of Qud embody this approach. These games prioritize functionality over appearance and effectively utilize the available resources.
2. I wanted to challenge myself to work within the constraints of a console-based environment and explore the capabilities of the ncurses library.
